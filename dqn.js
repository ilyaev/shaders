const tf = require("@tensorflow/tfjs-node");

// define the model architecture
const model = tf.sequential();
model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 32, inputShape: [4] }));
model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 32, activation: "relu" }));
model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 2 }));

// compile the model
model.compile({
  loss: "meanSquaredError",
  optimizer: "adam",
});

// generate some fake data
const xs = tf.randomNormal([100, 4]);
const ys = tf.randomNormal([100, 2]);

// train the model
model.fit(xs, ys, {
  epochs: 10,
  callbacks: {
    onEpochEnd: (epoch, logs) => {
      console.log(`Epoch ${epoch}: loss = ${logs.loss}`);
    },
  },
});
// This example defines a simple DQN with two hidden layers, each with 32 units and using the ReLU activation function. It then compiles the model using the mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer. It generates some fake data and uses it to train the model for 10 epochs, printing the loss at the end of each epoch.

// Note that this is a very simple example that only shows the basic structure of a DQN, and does not include important elements such as the experience replay buffer and the target network. A complete implementation of a DQN would be much more complex.
